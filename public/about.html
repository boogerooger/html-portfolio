<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am a random person on the internet :)</p>

<p>
  I'm from Romania and I'm currently working as an automation engineer but
  looking for a slight career change into web development. Imma be honest with
  yall here, I wanna be able to work from home. Automation is not that bad but
  if I can learn enough to land a fully remote job, that would be great! I would
  love to be able to work from home while chilling with my bf and my doggo :')
</p>

<p>
  Programming is cool and all but I've had my struggles with it during uni which
  is why I went with a more "hands-on" job, more practical. But I'm giving it
  another shot and so far this course is great! It's very detailed and helpful.
  Not to mention udemy is making learning very easy <3 </p>

<p>If you stumbled all the way over here and read everything, thank you for coming to my TED talk. I wish you the best of luck in your journey through web development! ^^</p>
