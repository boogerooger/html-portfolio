<h1>The Best Movies According to Meeee</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>
<p>Great director. Great actors. Great lines. Great story. So silly, so funny, so goofy, so unserious.</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>Favorite anime movie. Amazing, heartwrenching, wonderful visuals, touching story</p>

<h3>Spirit, Stallion of the Cimarron</h3>
<p>This one goes without saying. Greatest movie of all time, so much emotion, so many memories. Greatest depiction of maturing, love, freedom.</p>
